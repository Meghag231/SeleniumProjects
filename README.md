# SeleniumProjects

This repository contains automated tests built using Selenium, a popular web application testing framework. The tests are designed to validate the functionality and user experience of a web application under different scenarios and conditions.

The repository includes test scripts written in Java, Python, or any other supported programming language, along with the necessary configuration files and dependencies. The tests can be executed locally on the developer's machine or integrated into a continuous integration (CI) pipeline for automated testing.
